    Another important concept to create larger programs is **loops**. You'll
    use loops to repeat statements that you want executed more than once. Try
    this code in the interactive window:

    ```csharp
    int counter = 0;
    while (counter < 10)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Hello World! The counter is {counter}");
      counter++;
    }
    ```

    The `while` statement checks a condition and executes the statement
    following the `while`. It will repeat checking the condition and
    executing those statements until the condition is false.

    There's one other new operator in this example. The `++` after
    the `counter` variable is the **increment** operator. It adds 1
    to the value of counter, and stores that value in the counter variable.

    The `while` loop tests the condition before executing the code
    following the `while`. The `do` ... `while` loop executes the
    code first, and then checks the condition. It looks like this:

    ```csharp
    int counter = 0;
    do
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Hello World! The counter is {counter}");
      counter++;
    } while (counter < 10);
    ```

    This `do` loop and the earlier `while` loop work the same.

    Let's move on to one last loop statement.
