Now that you've built your app, you should be able to upload images and see the metadata that was tagged to the images by the Computer Vision API.

Browse to your application (you retrieved this URL in step one). Here is the command again if you don't have it handy:

```azurecli
az storage blob url -c $storageContainer --name index.html --account-name $storageAccount
```

Open the URL in your favorite web browser, and then upload an image into the application.  Then, select **Reload Images**. This will then rotate through all of the images you upload, and display the metadata.
