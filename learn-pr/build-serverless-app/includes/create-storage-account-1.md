What if you could spend all your time building and deploying great apps, and none of your time managing servers? Serverless computing lets you do just that because the infrastructure you need to run and scale your apps is managed for you.

One of the most basic ways that you can go serverless is to use an Azure Storage account to host a static website. We'll get started creating this first and then in subsequent tutorials in this learning module, we'll enhance this website by adding in other Azure services.

In this tutorial, you will:
- Learn about Azure Storage
- Host a website in Azure Blob Storage

At the end of the tutorial, you will also have the ability to check your knowledge about this information with a quiz challenge.
