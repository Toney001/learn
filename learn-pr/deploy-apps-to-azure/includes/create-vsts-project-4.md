To get started with CI/CD and manage the code commit process, build definitions, and release definitions, create a project in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

> [!NOTE]
> For this tutorial, you can use a free account to create a basic ASP.NET web app and CI/CD pipeline. If you do not already have a Team Services account, [create one](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137).

1. Open your Team Services dashboard in a web browser and choose **New project**.
2. Enter *myWebApp* for the **Project name**. Leave all other default values to use *Git* version control and *Agile* work item process, then select **Create**.
3. Once your project has been created, choose the option to **Initialize with a README or gitignore**, then select **Initialize**.
4. Inside your new project, choose **Dashboards** across the top, then select **Open in Visual Studio**:

Congratulations - You have created your first VSTS project!
