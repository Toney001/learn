Run the following code in the interactive window. To do that, type the following code block in the interactive window and click the **Run** button:

```csharp
int a = 18;
int b = 6;
int c = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(c);
```

You've just seen one of the fundamental math operations with integers. The `int` type represents an **integer**, a positive or negative whole number. You use the `+` symbol for addition. Other common mathematical operations for integers include:

- `-` for subtraction
- `*` for multiplication
- `/` for division

> [!TIP]
> Throughout this quick start, you can explore on your own by modifying the code you've written in the interactive window. This quick start provides examples that you can try at each step.

Start by exploring those different operations. Modify the third line to try each of these operations. After each edit, click the **Run** button.

Subtraction:

```csharp
int c = a - b;
```

Multiplication:

```csharp
int c = a * b;
```

Division:

```csharp
int c = a / b;
```

You can also experiment by performing multiple mathematics operations in the same line, if you'd like.

> [!TIP]
> As you explore C# (or any programming language), you'll
> make mistakes when you write code. The **compiler** will
> find those errors and report them to you. When the output
> contains error messages, look closely at the example code,
> and the code in the interactive window to see what to fix.
> That exercise will help you learn the structure of C# code.
