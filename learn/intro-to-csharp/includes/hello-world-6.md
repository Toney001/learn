Did you come up with something like this?

```csharp
string songLyrics = "You say goodbye, and I say hello";
Console.WriteLine(songLyrics.StartsWith("You"));
Console.WriteLine(songLyrics.StartsWith("goodbye"));

Console.WriteLine(songLyrics.EndsWith("hello"));
Console.WriteLine(songLyrics.EndsWith("goodbye"));
```
