Run the following code in the interactive window. To do that, type the following code block in the interactive window and click the **Run** button:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

Congratulations! You've run your first C# program. It's a simple program that prints the message "Hello World!". It used the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to print that message. `Console` is a type that represents the console window. `WriteLine` is a method of the `Console` type that prints a line of text to that text console.

Let's move on and explore more. The rest of this lesson explores working with the `string` type, which represents text in C#. Like the `Console` type, the `string` type has methods. The `string` methods work with text.
